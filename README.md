# tunnel-ly

Open source, selfhosted [ngrok.io](https://ngrok.io) clone

### Should I use this for anything important?

**Not yet**. This is extremely WIP, the client currently uses hardcoded values, the server _will_ likely panic and does leak memory, and there is no authentication. I'd love contributions, but I wouldn't recommend deploying this yet.

### Contributing

Contributions are extremely welcome! Please open an issue or PR if you have any questions or suggestions.
